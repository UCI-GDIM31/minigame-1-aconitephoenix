## Devlog
To describe the relationship between Components, GameObjects, and Scenes, I'd use our own bodies as a point of comparison. Our bodies are made up of cells, each having a specific code that dictates a specific purpose. Thus, these cells know exactly what to do and where exactly to exist, making up the various tissues in our body that then make our organs. The cells in this case could be the most basic/lowest representation of Components, that then contribute to the bigger GameObjects that are organs. Cells are specific to each organ, dictating their behaviors, and the organs carry unique collections of behaviors to help the body survive. A collection of organs (and bones and blood and whatever I guess) then make up the human body, which could be considered the relationship between the GameObjects and the Scene.
